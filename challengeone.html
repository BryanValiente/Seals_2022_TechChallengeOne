      <li>I believe nothing is hard just a lot of work</li>
      <p>
        I've had a change in mindset because of this. I have seen tasks as
        things that take lots of time.

      <li>I believe leadership is action not position</li>
      <p>
        I have been more proactive because of this creed. I'm working to be a
        very proactive person and less reactive.

      <li>I will not lie cheat or steal</li>
      <p>
        I have tried to be more honest because of this creed. This includes
        letting people know my thoughts.
